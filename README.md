## Deploys BIG-IP in Azure Cloud

This Terraform module deploys N-nic F5 BIG-IP in Azure cloud,and with module count feature we can also deploy multiple instances of BIG-IP.

## Prerequisites

This module is supported from Terraform 0.13 version onwards.

Below templates are tested and worked in the following version 

Terraform v0.13.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm v2.28.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v2.1.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v2.3.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.1.2

## Releases and Versioning

This module is supported in the following bigip and terraform version

| BIGIP version | Terraform 0.13 | 
|---------------|----------------|
| BIG-IP 15.x  | X |
| BIG-IP 14.x  | X |
| BIG-IP 13.x  | X |

## Password Management

|:point_up: |By default bigip module will have random password setting to give dynamic password generation|
|----|---|

|:point_up: |Users Can explicitly provide password as input to Module using optional Variable "f5_password"|
|----|---|

|:point_up:  | To use Azure key vault  password,we have to enable the variable "az_key_vault_authentication" to true and supply the variables with key_valut name,secret along with resource group name where azure key vault is defined|
|-----|----|

## Example Usage

We have provided some common deployment [examples](https://github.com/f5devcentral/terraform-azure-bigip-module/tree/master/examples) 

#### Note
There should be one to one mapping between subnet_ids and securitygroupids (for example if we have 2 or more external subnet_ids,we have to give same number of external securitygroupids to module)

Users can have dynamic or static private ip allocation.If primary/secondary private ip value is null, it will be dynamic or else static private ip allocation.

```
With Static private ip allocation we can assign primary and secondary private ips for external interfaces, whereas primary private ip for management
and internal interfaces.
```

If it is static private ip allocation we can't use module count as same private ips will be tried to allocate for multiple 
bigip instances based on module count.

With Dynamic private ip allocation,we have to pass null value to primary/secondary private ip declaration and module count will be supported.

Below example snippets show how this module is called. ( Dynamic private ip allocation )

```

Example 1-NIC Deployment Module usage

module bigip {
  count 		      = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-azure-1nic"
  resource_group_name         = "testbigip"
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt" , "public_ip" = true,"private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  availabilityZones           =  var.availabilityZones


}


Example 2-NIC Deployment Module usage

module bigip {
  count                       = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-azure-2nic"
  resource_group_name         = "testbigip"
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt" , "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true,"private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
  availabilityZones           =  var.availabilityZones
}


Example 3-NIC Deployment  Module usage 

module bigip {
  count                       = var.instance_count 
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-azure-3nic"
  resource_group_name         = "testbigip"
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt" , "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
  availabilityZones           =  var.availabilityZones
}

Example 4-NIC Deployment  Module usage(with 2 external public interfaces,one management and internal interface.There should be one to one mapping between subnet_ids and securitygroupids)

module bigip {
  count                       = var.instance_count
  source                      = "../../"
  prefix                      = "bigip-azure-4nic"
  resource_group_name         = "testbigip"
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt" , "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_external", public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" },{"subnet_id" = subnet_id_external2", public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external","securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
  availabilityZones           =  var.availabilityZones
}

.............

Similarly we can have N-nic deployments based on user provided subnet_ids and securitygroup_ids.
With module count, user can deploy multiple bigip instances in the azure cloud (with the default value of count being one )

```
#### Below is the example snippet for private ip allocation

```
Example 3-NIC Deployment with static private ip allocation

module bigip {
  count                      = var.instance_count
  source                     = "../../"
  prefix                     = format("%s-3nic", var.prefix)
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  mgmt_subnet_ids            = [{ "subnet_id" = data.azurerm_subnet.mgmt.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  "10.2.1.5"}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids     = [module.mgmt-network-security-group.network_security_group_id]
  external_subnet_ids        = [{ "subnet_id" = data.azurerm_subnet.external-public.id, "public_ip" = true, 
                                "private_ip_primary" = "10.2.2.40","private_ip_secondary" = "10.2.2.50" }]
  external_securitygroup_ids = [module.external-network-security-group-public.network_security_group_id]
  internal_subnet_ids        = [{ "subnet_id" = data.azurerm_subnet.internal.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "10.2.3.40"}]
  internal_securitygroup_ids = [module.internal-network-security-group.network_security_group_id]
  availabilityZones          = var.availabilityZones
}

```


### BIG-IP Automation Toolchain InSpec Profile for testing readiness of Automation Tool Chain components 

After the module deployment, we can use inspec tool for verifying the Bigip connectivity along with ATC components

This InSpec profile evaluates the following:

* Basic connectivity to a BIG-IP management endpoint ('bigip-connectivity')
* Availability of the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding')
* Version reported by the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding-version')
* Availability of the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services')
* Version reported by the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services-version')
* Availability of the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming')
* Version reported by the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming-version')
* Availability of the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service ('bigip-cloud-failover-extension')
* Version reported by the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service('bigip-cloud-failover-extension-version')

#### run inspec tests

we can either run inspec exec command or execute runtests.sh in any one of example nic folder which will run below inspec command

inspec exec inspec/bigip-ready  --input bigip_address=$BIGIP_MGMT_IP bigip_port=$BIGIP_MGMT_PORT user=$BIGIP_USER password=$BIGIP_PASSWORD do_version=$DO_VERSION as3_version=$AS3_VERSION ts_version=$TS_VERSION fast_version=$FAST_VERSION cfe_version=$CFE_VERSION
